### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. My journey into the world of AI started with a fascination for how machines can learn from data and make decisions. Since then, I've been honing my skills in building intelligent systems that can process and understand vast amounts of data, especially through the lens of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
